# EzAudioDeviceSwitch
Example of windows default audio device switching


What this program does:
Sets the default Input and Output devices using c#

Why I made it:
Microsoft decided to make it difficult to use the control panel to access default devices, instead offering users the simplified version with the new settings panel.
Also while doing research someone said it was impossible to do with c#, so of course I had to do it.
